Like so many other things in the past couple of months we have decided to go
full virtual.  Additionally we have decided to make some change ups for the time
being to make things a bit easier since we are all isolated.  So for the sake of
sanity we will be having our usual meetings on the first Tuesday of the month,
but in addition we will be adding in a second gathering for the group.

More details will be posted here shortly but if you would like to attend the
next session we will be sitting down to talk on May 19th, 2020 @ 6pm. Check the
channel for details.
