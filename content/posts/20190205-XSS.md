At this months meeting we had a good turnout to talk about the ins and outs of
cross site scripting and how it can be used.  Unfortunately I forgot to take a
picture, but that's the way that it goes sometimes.

Additionally for the meeting we introduced the new logo for DC720, which will be
added to the site soon. I have also added all of the future dates that we have
scheduled to the meetings page so that you can start planning ahead for the
meetings.
