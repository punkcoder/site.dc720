# Question: If your in boulder why not call it DC303

Because there has already been a DC303 (located in downtown Denver) that is a
group with a lot of history and I don't want to step on that. Boulder is covered
by the 303 and 720 area codes.

# Question: Additional information about DEFCON Groups

Awesome, if you would like to know more about the orgs from a higher level please feel free to check out the frequently asked question on the [DEFCON Groups FAQ](https://defcongroups.org/dcgfaq.html)

# Question: Why not go the 30m to Denver where you already have some of the best new and old school hackers around?

Couple of reasons...

* DC303 has a tendency to meet infrequently (check their website dc303.org)
* While it's only 30 miles to Denver, the 36 to 25 at rush hour can turn it into an hour or longer.
* (When they do meet) They meet on Fridays, the weekends usually belong to my family.
* Boulder has a lot of startup and cultural differences (talking tech at this point, not politics, thinks startups vs established businesses) in the tech.

Hope that answers your questions.
